**Project Overview**

**LMS_REV_1.0** or **Library Management System Version 1.0** <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------
## LMS_REV_1.0
This is a software project focused on developing a comprehensive Library Management System. 
This system will provide efficient management of library resources, including books, members, authors, and transactions, while incorporating 
robust exception handling and version history tracking.

## **Project Goals:**
The primary goals of LMS_REV_1.0 development are as follows:

## **Member Management:**

Create and manage member profiles, including personal information and borrowing history.
Enable member registration and authentication.
Define member privileges and restrictions (e.g., borrowing limits).

## **Author Management:**

Maintain an author database, including biographical information and a list of authored books.
Link books to their respective authors for easy cataloging and search.

## **Book Management:**

Catalog books with detailed information (e.g., title, ISBN, genre, publication date).
Track book availability, loan status, and location within the library.
Implement a search and sorting mechanism for efficient book retrieval.

## **Transactions:**

Record and manage book checkouts and returns by members.
Calculate due dates, fines, and penalties for late returns.
Generate receipts and notifications for transactions.

## **Exception Handling:**

Implement robust error handling and exception management to ensure system stability.
Handle scenarios such as book unavailability, member suspensions, and system errors gracefully.

## **Version History:**

Maintain a version history log to track system updates and changes.
Document new features, bug fixes, and enhancements with timestamps and descriptions.
